HOW TO USE THE NEWSLETTER TEMPLATE:

The "newsletter.html" file is a coded template designed for email marketing platforms.
To send this to a large list of clients, you should upload the HTML code into a platform 
like Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or SendGrid. These platforms will allow you to easily 
replace the placeholder images with your real property photos and send the newsletter 
cleanly to thousands of contacts.
